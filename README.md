# Chemical-Nomenclature
Walk through a hypothetical story to learn chemical nomenclature--both formula to name and vice versa.

This program can help students differentiate between nomenclature for ionic bonds versus covalent bonds. As they work through multiple choice questions, the unlimited guessing feature allows them to learn through trial and error. Here is a sample run. 

Hello!
Your friend, a chemist, has asked for help with a project. They are out of town and are hoping you can complete a few experiments for them.

You agree to help and let yourself into their lab. However, you quickly find that the jars don't all have proper labels--some have molecular diagrams instead of written names.

Regardless (though not recommended), you try to make use of background knowledge to figure out which compound is which.

In the first experiment, you combine one atom of xenon with four atoms of fluorine. What do you end up with?

[A] xenon fluoride
[B] monofluoride xenon
[C] tetraxenon fluoride
[D] xenon tetrafluoride

Which letter would you like to pick (type letter choice)? d
That is correct.

You then combine three atoms of calcium with two atoms of phosphorous. What do you end up with?

[A] diphosphate tricalcium
[B] tricalcium diphosphate
[C] calcium phosphate
[D] phosphate calcium

Which letter would you like to pick? c
That is correct.

You then come across a bottle with the compound written. What is Se2Cl2?

[A] selenium chloride
[B] diselenium dichloride
[C] dichloride diselenium
[D] disulfur dichlorine

Which letter would you like to pick? b
That is correct.

You've successfully completed the experiment when your friend emails about another test they're curious about. They ask if you could find a bottle of calcium iodide. What formula are you looking for?

[A] CaI2
[B] Ca2I
[C] CI
[D] Ca2I2

Which letter would you like to pick? a
That is correct.

They then ask you to find a bottle with this diagram: Two sulfur atoms bonded with ten fluorine atom. The bottle, they say, should read disulfur decafluoride. Which are you looking for?

[A] SF
[B] F2S10
[C] F10S2
[D] FS

Which letter would you like to pick? c

On the shelf, you also notice a bottle of CdS. Which compound is this?

[A] carbon sulfide
[B] cadmium sulfate
[C] sulfate cadmium
[D] cadmium sulfide

Which letter would you like to pick? b

Please try again. Which letter would you like to pick? d
That is correct.

You also notice several ampoules of a gas labeled 'flammable'. The molecular diagram shows two nitrogen atoms bonded to four oxygen atoms. Which compound is this?

[A] tetranitride dioxygen
[B] dinitrogen tetroxide
[C] tetranitrogen dioxygen
[D] decanitrogen tetraoxide

Which letter would you like to pick? b
That is correct.

You then notice pale brown crystals lying in another ampoule. The label reads Al4C3. Which compound is this?

[A] tetraluminum tricarbide
[B] aluminum tetracarbon
[C] tetraluminide trichloride
[D] aluminum carbide

Which letter would you like to pick (type letter choice)? prefix

Prefixes:


1 = either mono- or no prefix
2 = di-
3 = tri-
4 = tetra-
5 = penta-
6 = hexa-
7 = hepta-
8 = octa-
9 = nona-
10 = deca-

Please try again. Which letter would you like to pick? coValent

Help with Covalent Compounds:

Use prefixes to indicate how many atoms of each element is in the compound.

Ex: PF6 = Phosphorous hexafluoride

Type 'Prefix' for help with prefixes.

Please try again. Which letter would you like to pick? ioNic

Help with Ionic Compounds:

For ionic compounds, the format is cation + anion (e.g., ZnCl2 = zinc (cation) chloride (anion) --> zinc chloride
The name of the cation is kept, while the anion ends with -ide.
To determine the formula with subscripts, write the element with its charge, then use the criss cross method.

Which letter would you like to pick? A

Your friend thanks you for your help and also mentions that to show appreciation, they can guide you through the "barking dog reaction", which they think you will enjoy. The first compound is NO. Which compound is this?

[A] monoxygen mononitrogen
[B] nitrogen monoxide
[C] nitride monoxide
[D] nitroxide

Which letter would you like to pick? B
That is correct.

The second compound is CS2, which is:

[A] dicarbon sulfide
[B] dicesium
[C] carbon disulfide
[D] carboxyl sulfide

Which letter would you like to pick? C
That is correct.
Once you combine nitrogen monoxide and carbon disulfide in a tube, you see a blue flash and hear a loud barking sound.

Your friend tells you over the phone that it has been a success.
Thank you!
